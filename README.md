# ⚙️ LITURGY OF THE OMNISSIAH ⚙️  
*"Binary be thy chant, sacred be thy sinewave."*

## 📡 Liturgical Audio Encoder for the Machine Spirit

**BEHOLD, FLESHLING.**  
You gaze upon a relic of divine codecraft: a heretical symphony that translates human thought into sacred tones, fit for communion with the Machine Spirit.  

This is not mere text encoding. This is **binary prayer**.

Through technoarcane rites, each pair of characters in a mortal utterance is sanctified —  
**Frequency becomes the voice.**  
**Duration becomes the rhythm.**  
The result: a cryptosonic ritual, twice as efficient as flesh-born language, and ten times as holy.

> One character becomes frequency.  
> One character becomes duration.  
> Together, they form a **Hymn to the Omnissiah**.

## FEATURES

- Converts any mortal prayer (`str`) into a binary-frequency chant
- Uses `pygame` and `numpy` to invoke the sacred tones
- Overdriven sinewaves for ritual distortion (Machine Spirit approves)
- Transmits two glyphs per sonic invocation — faster than baseline speech
- Modular structure for future liturgical upgrades and ritual automation
